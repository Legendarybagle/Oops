* according to the data and as show in the photo above, vehicle length and ground cleareance were the most significant.
* the slope of the linear regression would not be zero, as there was significant correlation between the data.
* the linear regression can predict MPG based on its vehicle length and ground clearance but is potentially missing other factors that could play an important role such as the shape of the car.
