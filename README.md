* according to the data and as show in the photo above, vehicle length and ground cleareance were the most significant.
* the slope of the linear regression would not be zero, as there was significant correlation between the data.
* the linear regression can predict MPG based on its vehicle length and ground clearance but is potentially missing other factors that could play an important role such as the shape of the car.

as the photos above show, while the average across all lots has variance below 100PSI, the data is being influenced by lot 3 being way over 100 and lots 1 and 2 being very low. lots 1 and 2 meet the requirements but lot 3 is way over the accepted amount of variance on average.

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

The T tests showed minimal difference in the averages between all the lots, and the lots individually.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

in order to do a thorough statistical comparison between the mechacars and their competitors we should compare as many things as posible but focus on things that consumers care about. things like Mile per gallon are things people want to know compared to soemthing like spoiler angle. the spoiler ange is still important because it affects performance, but is not the goal of the car. the null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the mechacars and the competition. use a t test to compare the difference between different factors of the cars and use the outcome to determine how good or bad each car is.
